# touch-the-bees

My three-year-old cousin said that he wanted to play a game called "Touch the
Bees". This is my implementation of such a game, and my first project in
JavaScript. It is a work in progress, so all features may not be implemented.

If you have any pointers you'd like to share about my code, feel free to [open
an issue](https://github.com/jdw1996/touch-the-bees/issues/new) or email me at
[jdwinters96@gmail.com](mailto:jdwinters96@gmail.com).
